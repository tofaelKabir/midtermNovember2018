Conclusion: bubble sort, selection sort and insertin sort are fastest sorting
algorithm for small sized array and bucket sort is the worst.
For array with average size, heap sort and quick sort  fastest.
For array with large data size, bucket sort, heap sort, quick sort and merge sort
are the best sorting algorithm.
