Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. we need data structures to hold objects and variable in one accessible place

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. search, insert, delete, access

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. data structures are extensively used to store records in the form of objects

what is an Array?
A. an array is a datastructure provided by java to store a fixed collection of elements of the same type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. arrays are fixed in size and must be declared at the time of initialization, ArrayLists are dynamic and can grow or shrink accordingly
as the number of elements grow

what is LinkedList?
A. alinked list is a datastructure where records are stored in nodes and are linked by reference pointers from one node to another
node in memory

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. arrays are fixed,linked lists are dynamic, arrays have consatnt access time, while linked lists do not
however, insertion and deletion are constant in linked lists, while not in arrays

what is queue?
A. queues are abstract datastructures that implement the fifo methodology

what is stack?
A. stacks are also a abstract dataStructure but implement the lifo methodology

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. lifo stands for lastin first out and is used by queues, while Lifo stands for last in first out and is implemented by stacks

what is the order of complexity?
A. Order of complexity is a relative measure of how much cpu time a certain algorithm will take

wwhat is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.  O(1)

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. O(n)

what is tree in data structure?
A. a tree is any datastructure in which threre are nodes that are connected by edges

what is graph in data structure?
A. A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. hashmap is not threadsafe where as Hashtable is. also hashTable does not allow null key/values but hashmaps do

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. · RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)

   · Network data model – Graph

   · Hierarchical data model – Trees


How HashMap works in java?
A. hashMaps work by storing key value pairs which can then be used to compare results

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. this is an Exception that occurs when we try to access a index in an array that does not exist

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. arrays are fixed,linked lists are dynamic, arrays have consatnt access time, while linked lists do not
 however, insertion and deletion are constant in linked lists, while not in arrays

What is DFS and BFS?
A. depth first search is when when we try to visit the furthest nodes in a graph first, while breadth first search is when
we visited the nodes level by level in order to stay as close to the root as possible

What is Recursion?
A. recursion is the process in which a method repeatedly calls itself with smaller data set then the last until a base case is reached

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. linear data structures grow directly proportional to the number of elements, non linear DS grow either faster or slower than
linear ones

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. it’s useful to have a shorthand way to say how efficient a computer algorithm is. In computer science, this rough measure is called “Big O” notation.
it is a comparison that tells how an algorithm’s speed is related to the number of items.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A. bubblesort = n^2
   InsertionSort = n^2
   SelectionSort = 2^2
   QuickSort = nlogn
   mergesort = nlogn
   bucketSort= n+k

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.

A. array: search o(n), access o(1), insert o(n), deletion o(n)
   arraylist: search o(n), access o(1), insert o(n), deletion o(n)
   linkedlist: search o(n), access o(1), insert o(1), deletion o(1)
   stack: search o(n), access o(n), insert o(1), deletion o(1)
   queue: search o(n), access o(n), insert o(1), deletion o(1)
   B-Tree: search o(log n), access o(log n), insert o(log n), deletion o(log n)
